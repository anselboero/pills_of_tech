# Welcome! :)
My name is Ansel and I work as a Data Engineer in Berlin.

In this repository I'll try to write short blog posts related to what I'm studying and the challenges I'm facing during my learning paths. If this series will be useful for one single person I'd consider my goals reached.

I'm not a senior developer (this is not a financial advice wink), take a leap of faith about what you are going to read, and feel free to comment and suggest edits through pull requests.

Thank you everyone and happy coding!
